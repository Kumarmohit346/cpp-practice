Implementing cool programs

these programs are short,consise and too the point.

->A bit array (also known as bit map , bit set, bit string, or bit vector) is an array data structure that compactly stores bits. It can be used to implement a simple set data structure. A bit array is effective at exploiting bit-level parallelism in hardware to perform operations quickly. A typical bit array stores kw bits, where w is the number of bits in the unit of storage, such as a byte or word, and k is some nonnegative integer. If w does not divide the number of bits to be stored, some space is wasted due to internal fragmentation. (check bitVector.c for Implementation)

->Copy COnstructor(The copy constructor is a constructor which creates an object by initializing it with an object of the same class, which has been created previously. The copy constructor is used to:

 Initialize one object from another of the same type.

 Copy an object to pass it as an argument to a function.

 Copy an object to return it from a function. ) (check copyConstructor.cpp for implementation)
 
 ->PrintBytes prints bytes address allocated in memory for the given input. (check printBytes.cpp for implementation.)
